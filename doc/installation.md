# OptparseLite

## installation


### easy
the traditional, easy way from rubygems:

from the command line:
~~~
~ > gem install optparse-lite
~~~


### weird purist
OptparseLite is a single file with no dependencies.  If you want you can just
[grab the file](http://github.com/hipe/optparse-lite/blob/master/lib/optparse-lite.rb)
and throw it wherever.


### hack it?
Sure, why not:
from the command line:
~~~
~ > git checkout blah blah @todo
~~~


Then maybe check out the [usage](/usage/) to get started!
